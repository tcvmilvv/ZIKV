## Data Directory

This directory contains the minimal dataset required to reproduce the analysis presented in this project.

## Contents

### 1. `input/`
- **`zikv_structure.pdb`**: The PDB structure used for molecular dynamics simulations and subsequent analysis.

### 2. `simulation/`
- **`zikv_reduced_trajectory_50frames.xtc`**: A molecular dynamics trajectory file containing 50 frames sampled from the simulation. This dataset is a reduced version of the full trajectory for demonstration purposes.

## Notes
> [!NOTE] For full simulations or higher-resolution trajectories, please contact the authors.

> [!NOTE] The trajectory and PDB files are compatible with the analysis scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory.
